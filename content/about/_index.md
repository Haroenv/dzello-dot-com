I'm Josh Dzielak a.k.a *dzello*. In both cases, the "dz" is pronounced like the "j" in "jam".

I enjoy building tools for developers and finding unique, authentic ways to distribute them. Formerly, I was the Developer Relations Lead at [Algolia](https://algolia.com/), where I helped developers build fast and relevant search experiences. In the past, I've worked at companies like [Keen IO](https://keen.io/) and [Disney](https://github.com/disney), building APIs and helping get them into the hands of thousands of developers.
