I do consulting for developer relations teams and companies whose customers are developers. My goal is to create something extraordinary for my clients with every engagement.

# How can I help you?
I prefer engagements based around well-scoped projects with few dependencies and a high potential for impact. Here are a few examples of projects that can fit into that category.

# Where am I located?

I'm currently based on out Paris, France meaning that most or all of my work will be remote for US-based clients. I try to be as flexible as possible with my schedule so I can meet during the most convenient times for your team, wherever they may be around the globe.
