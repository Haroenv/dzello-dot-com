Today is the 13th day of my 365-day Github [contribution streak](http://dzello.com/blog/2014/06/23/open-source-365-ship-every-day-for-a-year/).

The first commit I made yesterday turned into something bigger, a new command line interface library for Keen. I wrote a post about it over on the [Keen blog](https://keen.io/blog/90382031171/365-days-of-open-source-contributions-heres-what). The tool itself, [keen-cli](https://github.com/keenlabs/keen-cli), is on Github.

In related Keen news, we just announced a [major milestone](https://keen.io/blog/90461717436/a-major-milestone-announcing-our-partnership-with) for our company. We've partnered with [Aaref Hilaly](https:/twitter.com/aaref) and the excellent team at [Sequoia Capital](https://www.sequoiacap.com/) to bring custom analytics to even more developers and organizations. I couldn't be happier to be a part of this ambitious, humble, and growing [team](https://keen.io/team).
