I was fortunate to be a panelist at the new [Sentry Scouts](https://www.meetup.com/Sentry/) meetup back in January created by [Chloe Condon](https://twitter.com/chloecondon), the developer evangelist at [Sentry](https://getsentry.com/). This meetup series rises above the rest and any organizer of events for developers can learn from its success.
