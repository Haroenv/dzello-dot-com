<p>Today I gave a presentation at Disney&rsquo;s HTML 5 Summit. It&rsquo;s about polyfills &ndash; generally, specifically, philosophically, etc.</p>

<p>Check it out here:</p>

<p>What do you think? Any feedback?</p>

<p>An Aside: I created this presentation with <a href="https://github.com/schacon/showoff">showoff</a>. It was *awesome*. All I had to write was a text file and copy in a few images. Showoff takes care of everything else &ndash; so cool. See the source code for my presentation <a href="https://github.com/dzello/shims_and_shivs">here</a>.</p>
