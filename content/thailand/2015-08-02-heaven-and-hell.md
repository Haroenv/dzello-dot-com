One week in and my mindfulness practice has already paid off.

I went running on Friday for the first time in months. One of the volunteers, Estelle from France, asked if anyone wanted to join her for a jog and I, feeling healthy and optimistic, said yes. There’s a beautiful lake in the middle of Khon Kaen that’s circled by a multi-use path; the setting couldn’t have been nicer. We made one lap around the lake along with Amy from England, around 5km in total, without stopping.

Back near our starting point, I decided to call it quits. My quads were already hurting.

That evening was filled with whisky and dancing, rare and unendorsed luxuries for [Mindfulness Project](http://www.mindfulness-project.org/) volunteers, and neither good for sore muscles. We were out until at least 2. I woke up the next morning at 9, swallowed a breakfast of ibuprofen and water, and climbed into a tuk-tuk headed back to the monastery. There’s a Thai massage school there, one of the best in the region, and a dozen of us had 2-hour appointments booked for 10am. I arrived on time, changed into the massage clothes I was given, and now that the moment of massage was on hand I became very excited.

Two minutes later the excitement turned into horror. The first press on my legs, right above the knees, shot a seething spike of pain through my entire body. I convulsed. My back arched and my pelvis lifted so violently that I almost flew off the mat. The area above my knees is always sensitive and I had forgotten how much worse the sensitivity is after a run, especially when it’s the first in months. I would never in a million years have gone in for a massage if I had remembered this, let alone a Thai massage, let alone by a man my size who (I swear) sharpens his elbows against his knees and vice versa. What the hell was I going to do?

Thai massage is to massage what rugby is to soccer. Inflicting pain is allowed, encouraged even! How could I withstand this much pain for the next 1 hour and 58 minutes? On the other hand, how could I quit? In the last week I’ve sat in immobile silence for hours at time, sustained more than one hundred mosquito bites, rolled sunburned out of bed each day at 5am onto a yoga mat, and showered under buckets of cold collected rainwater. Of all the things, was it *getting a massage* that was to be my undoing?

Out of my head and back on the massage mat I was nearly biting through my teeth. My five senses had been replaced with just one, a ceaseless accumulator of pain. Each successive stroke of the massage coughed up new flashes of white light and hums of white noise to swallow and concomitantly regurgitate into more pain. I started to feel nauseous. I was about to quit.

Then I remembered mindfulness. “Oooh…”, I thought to myself, “what a test this is, what a (really) great opportunity to be in such pain…”. Mindfulness is the challenge to elevate from experiencer to observer. Could I, using the techniques I had just learned, observe this pain instead of experiencing it? I had to find out.

Mindfulness begins with the breath. Right? Right. So I started to breathe. In and out. In and out. In… and out. The massage moved from the legs to the less sore arms, allowing a glimmer of relief to shine through the wall of pain. In… and out. I started counting along with the breath. 1 in, 2 out, 3 in, 4 out… all the way to 10, then start over. We do this in meditation to increase our concentration.

The remaining time saw a fitful pendulum swing between heaven and hell. One moment I was sure I had unlocked the key to the universe of pain management, only for the next moment to bring me to the verge of tears. Somehow I made it through the full two hours, completely exhausted and soaked in sweat at the end (eww).

The moral of the story is don't get a Thai massage when your muscles are sore, but if you screw that up like I did, breath and counting are your best friends.
