I ran on Friday for the first time in months. Estelle from France asked if anyone wanted to join her for a jog and I, feeling so healthy and optimistic from all that meditation, said yes. There’s a beautiful lake in the middle of Khon Kaen that’s surrounded by a path, an undeniably low barrier to running.

Amy from England came along and the three of us completed the first 5km lap without stopping. But that would be it for me. My quads were already hurting and once we reached our point of origin I excused myself to go buy ice and a coffee in a place with comfortable chairs. Hours later and sufficiently rehydrated, I joined the rest of the [Mindfulness Project](http://www.mindfulness-project.org/) volunteers for an evening of dancing and whisky, rare luxuries unendorsed by the project and not great for recovering muscles either.

I was out until 2am. At 9am I woke up and swallowed a breakfast of ibuprofen and water, then climbed into a tuk-tuk headed for the monastery. There’s a Thai massage school there—the best in Khon Kaen—and a dozen of us volunteers had 2-hour appointments booked for 10am. I arrived on time, changed into a starchy and oversized set of massage clothes, and set down on my massage mat carefully, putting down one leg first and rolling my body over it, finally shifting the weight off of my arms as I laid back flat.

After several relaxing minutes of eavesdropping on conversations in Thai I had no chance of understanding, my masseuse arrived to greet me. He was a large Thai man, large even by American standards, and his arms and legs had the bursting-at-the-veins appearance of someone who'd just left the gym. Oh good, I thought, someone who can really loosen me up.

His first press into my legs, an inch above the knees, shot a seething spike of pain through my entire body. I convulsed. My back arched and my pelvis lifted so high that I must have graced the man's chest with my waist. I had completely forgotten how sensitive quads become after a run, especially after months of delicately excusing myself from each opportunity to move. Had I rememberer that, I would never have gone in for a massage, let alone a Thai massage, a carefully-architected cavalcade of sharp elbows and knees perfectly coordinated to separate muscle from bone.

If massage was soccer, Thai massage would be rugby. Physical contact and the infliction of pain upon the opponent isn't just allowed, it's encouraged, it's *required* to win!

I had 1 hour and 58 minutes left to enjoy my massage. Or rather to survive it. I couldn't give up. Could I?

No. In the last week I’d meditated in silence for three hours at a time. I'd been bitten by one hundred mosquitos, each better at hiding than the next. I'd slept with only a yoga mat and a horrible sunburn between me and the floor. I'd woken up at 5am every day, scrambling to remove my mosquito net in a lightless room. I'd showered in as little as two buckets of rainwater. After all of this, would *getting a massage* be my undoing? Would *getting a massage* be the thing that makes me call my airline and beg for a spot on the first flight tomorrow from Bangkok?

No. That would be so lame. I came here to learn something, not give up at the first or hundredth moment of discomfort. I came here to learn to meditate. Isn't this a good time to practice? Don't I *really* need meditation right now?

Back on the mat, where my consciousness existed exclusively except for such tiny openings to contemplate an escape, the masseuse flipped me over and starting working on my back. I bit through my teeth as his palms pushed my lower vertebrae over to the dark side of my stomach. My five senses had been replaced with just one, a ceaseless accumulator of pain, curdling my dendrites and synapses with every new blow from the Thai massage.

Meditation. Mindfulness. Where is it?

Mindfulness begins with the breath. Right? Right. So I started to breathe. In and out. In and out. In and out. The masseuse moved from my legs to my arms, much less sore, and a glimmer of relief peaked out from behind the wall of pain. Breathe. In and out. I started counting. 1 inhale, 2 exhale, 3 inhale, 4 exhale… all the way to 10. Then I started over. Again and again.

The remaining 90 minutes of the massage had me swinging between heaven and hell. One moment I was sure I had unlocked the key to the universe of pain management, only for the moment to bring me to the verge of tears. But thanks largely to meditation—to breathing and counting—I made it through the full two hours, completely exhausted and soaked in sweat.

The moral of the story is don't get a Thai massage when your muscles are sore, it's a really bad idea.
