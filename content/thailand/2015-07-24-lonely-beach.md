It took a bus, an overnight, multiple taxis and a ferry to get from Bangkok to Koh Chang. It wasn’t the fastest route, but it was cheap, and not as stressful as a careening cliff-side minibus would have been.

Some parts were a bit stressful — the hangovers, the studio audience of a slapstick Thai TV show shrieking endlessly over the bus speakers, and the frequent stops. Ugh, the stops. God forbid that a bus should make stops.

*What a bus should do is go directly to each passenger’s destination without stopping until it is empty. Then it should park itself next to a unicorn. Unicorns are imaginary too.*

Once on Koh Chang (*Koh* meaning island, *Chang *meaning elephant) we hopped a truck taxi to White Sand Beach. Cristina (with no *h*), Skip, and I settled into affordable oceanfront accommodations. Tiny wooden huts, steps from the water, for less than $15. Low season has its upside.

Stretches of the Thai coastline are at best imaginary and at worst reverse-engineered from a screensaver. Especially when they are accompanied by swings. Night after night the tide overwhelms the sand, drawing water under the swing, adding to all the magic.

We spent one night at White Sand Beach, then rode down the coastline to Lonely Beach, quickly finding another beautiful beachside bungalow to house us. You could feel the ocean mist hit your face, right there on the patio.

The streets of Lonely beach are narrow and dusty. Scattered overhead are party flags, better suited to high season, but cheery even in July.

Ultimately the lack of crowds led to a lack of another thing, a dangerous thing. There were no lines to get a tattoo. So, on a whim, Cristina (still no *h*) and I got one. A bamboo tattoo at that, meaning the needles are made of bamboo and every last bit is done by hand.

It was my second tattoo. It’s the top half of what you see in the picture. Cristina drew the design on the spot and I believe — the vodka was less generous to my memory at this point— used the word *möbius* to articulate its true nature to the artist. So let’s call it Möbius. I like Möbius.

My first tattoo is the three lines underneath, and its name is Chill Vibes. I asked the tattoo artist to make them go together — they’re both friend tattoos so they themselves should be friends.

Skip didn’t get a tattoo with us, but to be fair he was already back in Bangkok singing karaoke at a 6-seat lounge called Woodball with a Hungarian model who could carry a tune equally well in Japanese and English and who-knows-what else. Hi Alexandra!
