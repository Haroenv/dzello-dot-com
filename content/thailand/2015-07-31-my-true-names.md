Our teacher at the Mindfulness Project read us this beautiful poem during one of our nightly teachings. It was written by [Thích Nhất Hạnh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Nh%E1%BA%A5t_H%E1%BA%A1nh), the well-known Vietnamese Buddhist monk, poet, and peace activist.

## Please Call Me By My True Names

*Don’t say that I will depart tomorrow even today I am still arriving.*

*Look deeply: every second I am arriving to be a bud on a Spring branch,
to be a tiny bird, with still-fragile wings, learning to sing in my new nest,
to be a caterpillar in the heart of a flower, to be a jewel hiding itself in a stone.*

*I still arrive, in order to laugh and to cry, to fear and to hope.*

*The rhythm of my heart is the birth and death of all that is alive.*

*I am a mayfly metamorphosing on the surface of the river.*

*And I am the bird that swoops down to swallow the mayfly. I am a frog swimming happily in the clear water of a pond.*

*And I am the grass-snake that silently feeds itself on the frog. I am the child in Uganda, all skin and bones, my legs as thin a bamboo sticks.*

*And I am the arms merchant, selling deadly weapons to Uganda. I am the twelve-year-old girl, refugee on a small boat, who throws herself into the ocean after being raped by a sea pirate.*

*And I am the pirate, my heart not yet capable of seeing and loving.*

*My joy is like Spring, so warm it makes flowers bloom all over the Earth. My pain is like a river of tears, so vast it fills the four oceans.*

*Please call me by my true names, so I can hear all my cries and laughter at once, so I can see that my joy and pain are one. Please call me by my true names, so I can wake up and the door of my heart could be left open, the door of compassion.*

— Thích Nhất Hạnh
