I do consulting for developer relations teams and companies whose customers are developers. My mission is help companies increase their value by increasing the value that they add to the developer community. My goal is to create something extraordinary for my clients with each engagement.

# How can I help you?
I prefer engagements based around concentrated, well-scoped projects with few dependencies and a high potential for impact. Here are a few examples.

# Where am I located?

I'm currently based out of Paris, France meaning that most or all of my work will be remote for US-based clients. I try to be as flexible as possible with my schedule so I can meet during the most convenient times for your team, wherever they may be around the globe.
