description = '''
Do developers truly understand what your product does? Why it's different than your competitors? Why they can't just use open source instead? Great developer products can still be handicapped by a failure to clearly articulate both the problem and the solution, and it's impossible to build a compelling content strategy or a thriving community without addressing that first.

Drawing on over 15 years of being a developer and 5 years building developer tools and communities, I can help you understand the way that your product makes developers feel and identify opportunities to improve your product, positioning and messaging.
