# Don't DevRel alone!

I do consulting for developer relations teams and companies whose customers are developers. My mission is help companies grow by increasing the value that they add to the developer community.

# How can I help you?
I prefer engagements based around concentrated, well-scoped projects with few dependencies and a high potential for impact. Here are a few examples.

# Where am I located?

I'm currently based out of Paris, France meaning that most or all of my work will be remote for US-based clients. I try to be as flexible as possible with my schedule so I can meet during the most convenient times for your team, wherever they may be around the globe.
