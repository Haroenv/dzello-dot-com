I’m sitting at SFO International Gate G99, charging my body with pizza and my devices with the cables that I did not forget (yes!).

The new, GOLD, Macbook is at 96%, not surprising, because this is the finest laptop I have ever laid fingers on, in like every way, battery life especially. Right now it’s using a grand total of 3.66 watts, and I’m even listening to a song. For 8 more hours I can do just that. And the keyboard is so snappy, so pleasant to type on. I will write more on this trip on sole account of that.

My Kindle is only at 50% and I am unable to improve that. There are too few outlets and too many children, all quicker on the draw than I am. But it’s cool, their games drain battery much faster than my e-books.

To Beijing is 11 hours, from there to Bangkok is 5. Plenty of time to finish *On the Road* by Jack Kerouac, *The Story of Philosophy* by Will Durand and start *Thailand* by Lonely Planet.
