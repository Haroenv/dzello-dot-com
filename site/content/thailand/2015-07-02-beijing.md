It’s here I have a two hour layover. Two and a half now it seems.

I’m tired. It’s 4am where I came from and 7pm where I am. 6pm where I’m going. 12pm there when I’ll arrive. Making meaning of those numbers requires a sort of mental math I’m not awake enough for right now.

It’s tripping me out that I’m in China. China. It’s something about the size and significance of this country that makes me feel weird that I haven’t been here before. I was fortunate enough to have a window seat on the flight over, and a beautiful view of Beijing on the descent. Buildings for miles, and miles, and miles.

Despite the fatigue, I accomplished the one goal I had for this layover, which was to figure out a place to stay tonight. There’s an endless boulevard in Bangkok called Sukhumvit, along which exists at [least a hundred things](http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//a/a6/Sukhumvit-map.png) to do. There’s also an [Aloft hotel there](https://www.starwoodhotels.com/alofthotels/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=3211), and I can use the points I accumulated from years of consulting to stay a few nights for free. The process should be familiar and easy, and that’s just what I need right now.
