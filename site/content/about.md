I'm Josh Dzielak a.k.a *dzello*. The "dz" is pronounced [d í], like the "j" in "jam". A software engineer for over 15 years, I enjoy building tools for developers and helping others learn how to use them. Previously, I was the Developer Relations Lead at [Algolia](https://algolia.com/). In the past, I've worked at companies like [Keen IO](https://keen.io/) and [Disney](https://github.com/disney), building APIs and helping get them into the hands of thousands of developers. After being in San Francisco for 10 years, I now live in Paris with my wife.
