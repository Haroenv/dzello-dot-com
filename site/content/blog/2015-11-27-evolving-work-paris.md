Recently I was asked to give a talk about startups to the pr√©pa classes of [St. Jean de Passy](http://www.saintjeandepassy.fr/) in Paris, France. These are top French students on the business school track. They're super sharp and it was a privilege to spend time with them.

I chose to talk about how startup teams are structured and why thoughtful organization design is becoming a big competitive advantage. I wanted the students to think about questions like: *How can companies grow large without succumbing to bureaucracy?* and *What makes work fun?*

The book [Reinventing Organizations](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/) by Frederic Laloux deals with these sorts of questions and has become a big inspiration to me and my startup colleagues. Early chapters look at different ways that humans have organized throughout history. Later chapters make a compelling case for what lies ahead, including case studies of several modern-day *Teal* companies.

This presentation is my attempt to share some of the book's wisdom with St. Jean's students. Here's a link to the [full slides](https://dzello.github.io/evolving-work).

*Technical Note: The presentation was created using the excellent open source [reveal.js HTML presentation framework](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/). It works on desktop and mobile and supports direct linking to individual slides. The source code is [on Github](https://github.com/dzello/evolving-work).*
