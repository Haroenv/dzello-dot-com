<boom>B</boom>eing a developer advocate is supposed to be fun, right? Just check the twitter feed of any tech conference and you'll see photos of advocates giving talks, demoing cool tech or immersed in conversation with developers that are genuinely interested in what they have to say.

To the person who possesses a particular mix of geekiness and charisma, being a developer advocate sounds like a dream job come true. And it can be.

It is gratifying when you get a big round of applause after a talk, or when you get a thank you note from a developer saying that your 15-minute conversation saved them hours of headache. Add to that the satisfaction of seeing developers that you talked to sign up, use your product and (for some of them) pay your company real money.

So then, why do we find lots of quotes like this one in talks at developer relations conferences and on the internet:

> "In my experience, if a brand new role is being created at an organization for an evangelist / advocate, and that individual is brand new to that organization, you probably won't be working there more that 14-18 months--have a plan B." <br>â€” Kin Lane on [apievangelist.com](http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/07/the-70-platforms-with-job-postings-for-a-developer-evangelist-or-advocate-currently/)

I first saw that quote not long after I joined Algolia in May 2015. I brushed it aside thinking that that couldn't possibly happen to me. Sure, it was my first official job as a developer advocate and the company's first developer relations hire, but I was bringing in significant experience from another similar-stage API company and I had a deep technical background that included having been a VP Engineering.

In the end, that experience did count for something: I lasted 21 months instead of 14-18.

## Success is not guaranteed

Despite knowing them all by name, I still made all the classic mistakes:

- Didn't clearly set **expectations**
- Didn't have a clear **vision**
- Didn't **measure** the impact

Because developer relations is ultimately a **stragic, optional investment** for any company, any one of these mistakes can spell doom for a developer relations team or, in my case, team leader.

I want to help developer relations teams because I know how much it sucks when it's not working. We can talk about burnout, I was there. We can talk about frustration, I was frustrated and so was the company. We can talk about hiring developer advocates but failing to set them up for success - that part was the worst.

My belief is that it doesn't have to be that way.
