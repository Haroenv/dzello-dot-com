<boom>B</boom>eing a developer advocate is supposed to be fun, right? Just check the twitter feed of any tech conference and you'll see photos of advocates giving talks, demoing cool tech or talking with people who share their passion. To the person who possesses that curious mix of geekiness and charisma, being a developer advocate sounds like a dream job come true.

I find it truly gratifying when you get a big round of applause after a talk or when you get a thank you note from a developer saying that your 15-minute conversation saved them hours of headache. On top of that, there is the great satisfaction of seeing developers that you talked to sign up, use your product and pay your company money.

But if DevRel is so great, why do we often hear quotes like this at our conferences:

> "In my experience, if a brand new role is being created at an organization for an evangelist / advocate, and that individual is brand new to that organization, you probably won't be working there more that 14-18 months--**have a plan B**." <br>â€” [Kin Lane](https://twitter.com/apievangelist) on [apievangelist.com](http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/07/the-70-platforms-with-job-postings-for-a-developer-evangelist-or-advocate-currently/)

I first saw that quote not long after I joined [Algolia](https;//algolia.com/) in May 2015. I quickly brushed it aside thinking that that couldn't possibly happen to me. Sure, it was my first official job as a developer advocate and the company's first developer relations hire, but I was bringing in significant experience from another similar-stage API company and I had a deep technical background that included having been a VP Engineering.

In the end, that experience did count for something: I lasted 21 months instead of 14-18.

## Success is not guaranteed

I made a lot of rookie DevRel mistakes:

- Didn't have a clear **vision**
- Didn't clearly set **expectations**
- Didn't measure the **impact**

Without these in place, a developer relation team is like a ship without a compass. Their efforts move them forward, sometimes at an impressive clip, but they don't stay pointed in one direction long enough so they end up going around in circles.

I want to help developer relations teams because I know how much it sucks when it's not working. Stress, frustration, burnout. Many of us have been there.

DevRel **teams** and **individuals** need healthy, reasonable goals that will have a measurable impact on their organization. **Companies** need to know they're getting a return on their DevRel investment and they also have to understand how to set their DevRel teams up for success.

## Success is easier together

It's not always easy for DevRel individual contributors or leaders to create a compelling vision, set reasonable expectations, or execute fast enough to demonstrate impact. Especially when trying to do all three at once. There's no one-size-fits-all DevRel playbook to follow and it's easy to get trapped chasing local maxima when you don't know what's been tried and what's possible.

To navigate the maze, I think that most DevRel teams will benefit a lot from external help. Already, many teams retain mentors and advisors or engage the services of consultants like [Hoopy](https://hoopy.io/), [Cristiano Betta](https://betta.io) and [Mary Thengvall](https://twitter.com/mary_grace) to name just a few.

I started my career in consulting and I've consistently made it a point to mentor others. Starting to do DevRel consulting officially is really just an extension of that, building on both my consulting and DevRel experience.

Consulting gives me an opportunity to go deeper than mentoring, to truly understand the challenges and competition each team is facing, and help in both the strategy and execution.

On my [consulting page](/consulting), you can learn more about a few offerings I've highlighted:

- Product & positioning deep dive
- Open source strategy
- Community strategy
- Technical content strategy

My mission is to help DevRel teams and companies increase their value by increasing the value they provide to the developer community.
