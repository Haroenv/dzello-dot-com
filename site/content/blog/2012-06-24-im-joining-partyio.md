My search for what's next has ended. I'm joining forces with the super-talented [ninakix](https://twitter.com/ninakix) at party.io!

Nina is actually *from* the Internet. Have you read Nina's TechCrunch post about the [social network paradox](http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/28/the-social-network-paradox/)? They're definitely worth checking out.

I'm taking on CTO duties, like these:

* building our technology
* creating a sustainable culture
* hiring talented people

Lots of great stuff to come!
