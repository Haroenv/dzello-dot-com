+++

**tl;dr:** I've joined [Algolia](https://algolia.com/about) as a developer advocate!

Algolia helps developers build amazing search experiences *inside* of products and apps. Companies like [Medium](https://medium.com/search) and [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/search) use Algolia to deliver a super fast search-as-you-type experience. Popular developer tools like [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Scala](http://docs.scala-lang.org/) and 100+ [more](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs) use Algolia to make their [documentation instantly searchable](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/), all for free as part of Algolia's community program. The search box on this blog is powered by [an Algolia-based project](https://blog.algolia.com/instant-search-blog-documentation-jekyll-plugin/) too.

I'm based in Paris but will also be in San Francisco and on the road, hopefully connecting to a Wi-Fi network near you. Drop me a line at my [shiny new email address](mailto:josh@algolia.com) if you'd like to chat about integrations, open source projects, co-hosting events and all things search and API-related.

## Hello Community! ðŸŽ‰

I want to say a very **special hello** to Algolia developers, customers and supporters. It's a
