+++

Starting this month, I'm going to spend more time consulting and advising startups on developer relations. Developer relations (DevRel) is an area I'm very passionate about and where I see a lot of opportunity for founders and early teams to professionalize their approach.

For the last 5 years I've been working at business-to-developer (B2D) companies, first as the VP Engineering at [Keen IO](https://keen.io/) and most recently as the Developer Relations Lead at [Algolia](https://algolia.com/). I've spoken about DevRel at conferences like [DevXCon](https://devrel.net/developer-experience/scale-community-support-apis) and [API Days](https://speakerdeck.com/dzello/7-ways-to-search-for-a-camelcased-parameter-in-your-docs") and invested hundreds of hours getting to know developer advocates and evangelists across the world. I've advised startups on a broad range of topics, from developer experience to open source marketing to global ambassador programs.

What I'm seeing now is that the number of startups who care about developers is growing rapidly, but it is getting harder for those startups to get access to people who have experience working with developers. As a result, they start off on the wrong foot.

These are the companies I want to help. Consulting is really just taking mentoring a step further, giving me the ability to more deeply get to know the product, team and competition of each company, and also being able to pitch in on both strategy and execution.

If you're interesting in discussing how I might be able to help your team, you can [email me](josh@dzello.com) or use the contact form on the [consulting page](/consulting). If you want to learn more about how startups can approach developer relations, please keep reading.

## There is no playbook

The only thing that developer relations teams seem to have in common is that they are all unique in what is actually working for them. Meetups are a gold mine for some companies and a waste of time for others. A community Slack group might be a fruitful source of product insights for one organization but a never-ending stream of free support for another.

It's a bit of an oversimplification, but if we look at some of the most successful B2D companies today, we can trace a lot of their early success back to one or two particular strategies:

- Twilio - hackathons + demos
- Firebase - hackathons + t-shirts
- SendGrid - accelerator partnerships + "be everywhere"
- Algolia - free search for logo placement
- Digital Ocean - referral program
- Heroku - free credits
- Auth0 - developer content marketing
- Netlify - community outreach + JAMStack

All of these companies did more than that too, but that's what I remember each company for, the things that worked that I saw them repeat over and over again.

## Build your own playbook

One of the most common questions I get from B2D companies is *what is going to work for us?* A good, straightforward place to start experimenting is at the intersection of:

- what your team is good at
- where your community can be reached

If your engineering team likes to write and your target developers like to read blog posts, try a few. If your team is extroverted and knows how to make the most out of a meetup, try sponsoring one in your town that already has traction with developers you want to get in front of. If your CTO is a great speaker, have them submit CFPs to conferences relevant to your field. If you have a social media star on the team, see where a few weeks of heavy twitter engagement on a few hashtags gets you.
