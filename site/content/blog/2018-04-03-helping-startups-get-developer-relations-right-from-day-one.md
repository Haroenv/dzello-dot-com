Starting this month, I'll be available for consulting and advising startups on developer relations. I love helping founders and early teams think through how they're going to get developers to try out and eventually fall in love with their product.

In the last five years I've worked at two business-to-developer (B2D) companies spanning 6 to 200 employees, first as the VP Engineering at [Keen IO](https://keen.io/) and then the Developer Relations Lead at [Algolia](https://algolia.com/). I've spoken at conferences like [DevXCon](https://devrel.net/developer-experience/scale-community-support-apis) and [API Days](https://speakerdeck.com/dzello/7-ways-to-search-for-a-camelcased-parameter-in-your-docs") and invested hundreds of hours getting to know developers, developer advocates and evangelists all over the world. I've advised dev-facing startups on a broad range of topics including developer experience, open source strategies, launching online communities & more.

I've learned a lot of lessons over the past few years, a lot of do's and even more don'ts. As a consultant and advisor to startups, my goal is to take what I've learned about building and growing developer platforms and developer relations teams and use it to help more companies get their relationship with developers off on the right foot. My mission is help companies increase their value by increasing the value that they add to the developer community.

If you're interested in discussing how I might be able to help your team, please [send me an email](mailto:josh@dzello.com) or head over to the [consulting page](/consulting) where you can learn more. Hope to talk soon!
