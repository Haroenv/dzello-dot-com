Last month was my 1-year anniversary at Algolia. Everyone gets a cake to share on both their birthday and work anniversaries. It's a very sweet tradition.

I spent 6 months of the year working out of our office in central Paris. Working in a different culture has been a great learning experience. I highly recommended working with people from different countries - I feel it's done a lot to improve my communication and listening skills.

### Community

I met a lot of developers using Algolia this year. I've also met a lot of developers that hadn't heard of us yet, but already it feels like that second group is shrinking dramatically. Through a combination of content, community, events and outreach Algolia has reached a large number of developers this year, and we don't plan on stopping any time soon.

What will next year hold? More API feature releases, new versions of open source projects, and more participation in conferences, events and meetups. As always, our goal will be to serve the needs of developers that best that we can. Maybe we'll even serve them some cake too.
