I gave a talk at the excellent [DevXCon 2017](http://devxcon.com) in San Francisco about how Algolia leverages our developer community to scale up support, while at the same time creating reusable content and community champions. A big thank you to [Matthew Revell](https://twitter.com/matthewrevell ) and the team at [Hoopy](https://hoopy.io/) for bringing so many developer relations practitioners together under one roof!
