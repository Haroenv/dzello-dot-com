+++

<p>When I moved into my current apartment in San Francisco's Dogpatch neighborhood, I invested considerable&nbsp;time and effort into getting Internet service from someone other than the incumbents - Comcast and AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>Long story short, I feel that the current ISP oligarchy is hampering innovation in the United States and may put <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality">Net Neutrality</a> at risk globally in the future. As it is, the US ranks 10th of 14 on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Broadband_Index_(gBBi)">Government Broadband Index</a>. If I, as an Internet Engineer, entrepreneur, open source contributor, etc, don't start using my dollars to upvote for more competition and transparency here, than who can I expect will?</p>
<p>After a month of searching, I found <a href="http://monkeybrains.net">monkeybrains.net</a>. I waited 2 months (an eternity for a developer to not have Internet), paid for installation, and soon enough I had awesome, indie internet. They are fantastic - I gave them 5 stars on Yelp and they deserve 6. The speed is fast, cheap, with no contract, and I didn't have to sign up for 243 cable channels and a land line.</p>
<p>That is partially why I was so frustrated today to receive the final decision from my building's HOA:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: small;">"the current equipment must be removed from the property within 10 business days (by August 31st, 2011)"</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A little while back I was informed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, new york, times, serif;">"This equipment was installed without the permission of the&nbsp;HOA&nbsp;Board and is in violation of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">section 7.7 of the [redacted] HOA&nbsp;CC&amp;Rs as outlined below"</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, they were right. I didn't ask them to install it, and looking back I know I should have. The antenna is about 12" long and looks like a TV remote. It was small so I didn't think it was a big deal.&nbsp;There's 2 big satellite dishes up there already. But I was wrong to not ask, and I did apologize to the board.</p>
<p>I let the board know that I'd work with Monkeybrains to get the installation to within the HOA's regulations. I also let them know that since I had paid the installation fee, anyone in the building can now get this great high-speed Internet service for a nominal monthly fee. Someone in my building did not too long after.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it turned out, however, due to line-of-sight restrictions, we couldn't get the installation to be within the rules of the HOA. There is about 50' of CAT-5 crossing the roof in a section that is outside of the area that is accessible to residents, but it is visible nonetheless. According to Monkeybrains we aren't able to spool out more wire due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_5_cable">CAT-5</a> cable maximum lengths to carry signal (about 328ft). So I guess me and the other guy are out of luck.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic">Update: The HOA eventually changed their mind and I was able to keep Monkeybrains. Hooray!</p>
