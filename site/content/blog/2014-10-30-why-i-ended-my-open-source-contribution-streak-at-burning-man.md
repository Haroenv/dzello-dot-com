*Streak* and *Burning Man* are in the title but I assure you that this post is G-rated and family-friendly. As of August 23rd I had contributed to open source for 66 days in a row:

Then, like any *[Whole Earth Catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Catalog)*-carrying [cyber-counter-culturalist](http://fredturner.stanford.edu/books/from-counterculture-to-cyberculture/) living in northern California, I went to Burning Man. 2014 was my 3rd year, and a truly special one thanks to the truly amazing people of Amazecamp.

The trip did, however, mark the end of my commit streak, a streak that had [started](http://dzello.com/blog/2014/06/23/open-source-365-ship-every-day-for-a-year/) back in June.

My goals were to boost productivity and give back to a movement that has given me so much. I hoped it would inspire others to do the same, and it did.

Dieter is still [going strong](https://github.com/ruleant) at 291! Coincidentally, he was just in SF this week from Belgium, so I got to buy him a beer:

That's us in the back. Also pictured is the Mild-Mannered Mustachio of Community, [@elof](https://twitter.com/elof), and a friend of Dieter's on the left.

Other developers chimed in with words of support and encouragement:

These messages were inspiring and validating, and they made the decision to end the streak in August really difficult. I had *planned* to keep the streak alive at Burning Man. Really. I brought my laptop. There are camps with WiFi. I would set aside one hour a day.

Heh. All wishful thinking it turned out, little more. As soon as I landed on the playa I just couldn't bring myself to think about opening a computer. Burning Man is where I come to get far away from tech, and a partial departure just isn't the same. So there and then, the first Sunday night, I let the streak lapse and promptly partied until sunrise.
