<boom>B</boom>eing a developer advocate is supposed to be fun, right? Just check the twitter feed of any tech conference and you'll see photos of advocates giving talks, demoing cool tech or immersed in conversation with developers that are genuinely interested in what they have to say. To the person who possesses a particular mix of geekiness and charisma, being a developer advocate sounds like a dream job come true. And it can be.

It is gratifying when you get a big round of applause after a talk, or when you get a thank you note from a developer saying that your 15-minute conversation saved them hours of headache. Add to that the satisfaction of seeing developers that you talked to sign up, use your product and (for some of them) pay your company real money.

So then, why do we find lots of quotes like this one in talks at developer relations conferences and on the internet:

> "In my experience, if a brand new role is being created at an organization for an evangelist / advocate, and that individual is brand new to that organization, you probably won't be working there more that 14-18 months--have a plan B." <br>— [Kin Lane](https://twitter.com/apievangelist) on [apievangelist.com](http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/07/the-70-platforms-with-job-postings-for-a-developer-evangelist-or-advocate-currently/)

I first saw that quote not long after I joined Algolia in May 2015. I brushed it aside thinking that that couldn't possibly happen to me. Sure, it was my first official job as a developer advocate and the company's first developer relations hire, but I was bringing in significant experience from another similar-stage API company and I had a deep technical background that included having been a VP Engineering.

In the end, that experience did count for something: I lasted 21 months instead of 14-18.

## Success is not guaranteed

I made a lot of rookie mistakes:

- Didn't have a clear **vision**
- Didn't clearly set **expectations**
- Didn't measure the **impact**

Without these firmly in place, developer relations teams are like ships without a compass—the wind still blows them forward but they never stay pointed in one direction long enough to reach some far-away shore.

I want to help developer relations teams because I know how much it sucks when it's not working. Stress, frustration, and our old friend burnout.

Developer relations teams and individuals need healthy, reasonable goals that create a measurable impact on their organization. Companies need to know they're getting a return on their DevRel investment and they also have to understand how to set their DevRel teams up for success.

I also want to do my part to improve the collective future of developer relations as a whole, an industry I've gained so much from. The field is growing lightning-fast and I hate to think that the evangelists, advocates and community managers of the future will also regularly be submitting CFPs about burnout, runaway expectations, organizational mistrust, and pains in calculating ROI. I hope they can soon get on to better things, like fundamentally changing the way that companies interact with their developers & customers by demonstrating how effective a high empathy, relationship-based approach can be. To me, that is worth investing in.

## Success is easier together

Since the beginning of my career, I've enjoyed helping people out of difficult situations or achieve things they didn't believe they could. My first job out of college was in consulting and I really valued the relationships I built with my clients.

Thoughout my career, I've made it a point to mentor others and to be available when a friend or a coworker needed support. This new venture into consulting is really just an extension of that, building on two strong foundations of experience.
